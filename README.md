# AWS Startup Blueprint

This is a strongly opinionated CDK application built for Startups looking to follow AWS best practices on Day 1. 

```bash
git clone GITURLGOESHERE
npm run build 
cdk bootstrap
```

Once that completes, to deploy or update the blueprint's architecture, you just need to run 

```bash 
npm run build && cdk deploy
```
